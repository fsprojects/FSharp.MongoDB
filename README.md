FSharp.MongoDB
==============

> an F# interface for the MongoDB .NET driver

**Disclaimer.** This is an experimental project being maintained in my _infinite free time_. It is
in no way supported by MongoDB, Inc., and probably shouldn't be used in production.

### Goals of this project

  * Provide an idiomatic F# API for interacting with MongoDB.
  * Have an implementation that is fully testable without connecting to a server.

### Non-goals of this project

  * Have feature parity with the [C# driver][csharp_driver].

Building
--------

  - Simply build the `FSharpDriver-2012.sln` solution in Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio, or Mono
    Develop. You can also run the FAKE script

      * `build.cmd` on Windows.
      * `build.sh` on Linux or OS X.

### Supported F# runtimes

  - FSharp.Core v4.3.0.0 (F# 3.0)
  - FSharp.Core v4.3.1.0 (F# 3.1)
  - FSharp.Core v4.4.0.0 (F# 4.0)

### Supported platforms
